# Automatic analysis on 16s rRNA sequencing data
# Please see the example files and paste your data to the related files
# Open '16s_analysis_pipeline_BZ 03242022.R' by Rstudio, select all the commands and click run
# If you are using a different file name as the input of reads table and/or metadata, please change the name to 'reads_table.csv' and/or 'metadata.csv'
# It's not necessary to have a 'control.csv' file. However, you may want to tell the program what is the control in each comparison, and you could make additional input into 'control.csv'
# make sure that factor and sample names and orders are the same in different input files.
